Charlie C. L. Wang is a Professor and Chair of Smart Manufacturing at the University of Manchester (UoM). Before joining UoM in 2020, he worked as a Professor and Chair of Advanced Manufacturing at Delft University of Technology after 2016 and as a Professor / Associate Professor / Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong after 2003. He also worked as a visiting professor at University of Southern California during sabbatical leave in 2011. He received his B.Eng. degree (1998) in mechatronics engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and his Ph.D. degree (2002) in mechanical engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Wang was the recipient of several awards, including the ASME CIE Excellence in Research Award (2016), the ASME CIE Young Engineer Award (2009), seven Best Paper Awards, five project-oriented technology innovation awards and three teaching awards. He was elected as a Fellow of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 2013, and is currently chairing the executive committee of Solid Modeling Association (SMA).
